I love to do projects.
The satisfaction you gain when you see what you created is THE best feeling.

[Great idea, thinking hard, many open questions]
I have this great idea for a landscaping project, but usually I only
have a rough intuition on
the actual work required, the materials and tools I need, and I definitely
never think about the cleanup afterwards.

It seems like even professionals mostly act on intuition which can go terribly
wrong. [BER]

Our vision is to enable you to succeed with your landscaping projects by leveraging
VR technology. 
This is not a game though!
We use VR gather analytics to automatically generate a detailed project report.

Let's see the prototype in action:
[Demo]
Everything starts with a 3D model of your manison.
Imagine generating this models directly from drohne images.

In just a few processing steps we transform the inanimate model
and make it immersive.

Watch Jannis do some yard work with his Stihl leave blower.

Just as he's done he can make some firewood for the winter.

Next he finally cleans up that big pile of dirt his wife hates so much.

As a precaution, he proceeds to reinforce his border wall.

Happy with the results, the detailed materials and tools
breakdown will prove invaluable in making his dream reality.
This automatially generated document even includes a
detailed map of the area!

[Mann vor Huette]
STIHL, can you help Jannis to find his tools?
Can you connect him with the right business to haul his dirt?

[Team]
Together with our expertise in data science and enterprise
software development we can make this ambitious vision reality!
